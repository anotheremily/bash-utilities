bash-utilities

This is a collection of bash scripts that I have found useful and 
collected into one spot for my reference.

Contents:
lowercase.sh	- Converts all the files in the current directory to lowercase
seq.sh          - "Clone" of *nix seq for use on OS X
tree.sh         - Partial "clone" of *nix tree for use on OS X
